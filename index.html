                <h2>Our history <small>so far</small></h2>
                <p>For many years, <strong>Bethany</strong> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we
                    opened
                    our first store
                    in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world
                    fell
                    in love
                    with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...<br><em><mark>The store became a success in no time.</mark></em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>In 2015,</b> no less than <strong>100</strong> pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger
                    building after making a &euro; 2000 revenue.
                    After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order
                    pies from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the
                    result of this:
                    our very own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like
                    it!
